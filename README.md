# Automatic_ABV
This repository contains the scripts for the suggested methodologies of automatic assertion mining for three benchmarks (APB, Arbiter, LBDR), experimental results, and GoldMine's results on the same benchmarks.
The configuration and results of GoldMiner are located in the "LBDR_goldminer_result" folder.
The experimental results and the scripts for our method are kept in the "ProposedMethod" folder, which consists of 4 files (each folder represents one phase of the methodology).
